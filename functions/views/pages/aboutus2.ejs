            mainstream online learning.
            <br> We want to spread education faster than COVID-19! </p> -->

        <h3>Spreading education faster than COVID-19.</h3>
        <p style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;">As students are being forced into online learning
            and many are losing their jobs due to the pandemic,
            we, the developers of Air Tutor, decided that we would like to aid both students and tutors in this time of
            need. We created Air Tutor, an online tutoring platform where students will be provided all the educational
            assistance they need and tutors will be incentivized for all the amazing work they do. </p><br>
