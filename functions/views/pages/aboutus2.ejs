        <h2>Spreading education faster than COVID-19.</h2>
        <p style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;">As students are being forced into online learning
            and many are losing their jobs due to the pandemic,
            we, the developers of Air Tutor, decided that we would like to aid both students and tutors in this time of
            need. We created Air Tutor, an online tutoring platform where students will be provided all the educational
            assistance they need and tutors will be incentivized for all the amazing work they do. </p><br><br>

                <p class="description">Dylan has gone through more career paths than he would have liked, but he’s here
                    to
                    stay. He enjoys the feeling of cabin fever as it’s somehow motivated him to pick up new hobbies such
                    as
                    gardening, table tennis and hosting online symposiums. He hopes to come out of quarantine speaking a
                    new
                    language (undecided). </p><br>

                    dawn.
                    When she is not doing schoolwork, she likes jamming on her bass guitar, slamming root beer floats
                    with
                    the boys, playing video games, and working on a very ambitious series of fantasy novels. After
                    receiving
                    her diploma, Chris intends on pursuing a degree in UI design and chasing her longtime dream of being
                    a writer.</p><br>

                    CST,
                    he plans on becoming a game programmer. When he is not working, he programs games or plays games,
                    plays
                    the guitar, piano, or ukulele, or hangs out with friends. </p><br>

                    she
                    wants her career to be on. Now she is a CST student at BCIT trying to become a programmer. She feels
                    accomplished when her friends and family like the websites she made. When she is free, she likes
                    playing
                    games with her friends, reading detective stories, and building wooden and plastic models.</p><br>
